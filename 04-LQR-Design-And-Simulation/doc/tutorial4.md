# Pytutorial 4 - LQR Design and Simulation

Todo:

- [ ] Figure out what plots I need for academic example
  - [x] What are the trajectory and initial value conditions, that show the difference between different linearization points most clearly? Answer: Trajectory from -2 to 2, (-2.1, 0.1), Trajectory from 2 to -2 (2.1, 0.1)
  - [ ] Plots: 
- [ ] Figure out code structure to generate those plots
- [ ] Make figures
- [ ] Figure out structure of text
- [ ] ...
